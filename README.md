This project illustrates the methods of styling a website with either CSS or with JQuery Mobile. It includes connections made by PHP code that request data from the MySQL database.

## Part - 1

All the following files refer to the connect.php to access the database and extract information to display in the index.php:

  * getfeature.php
  * getcontent.php
  * category.php

## Part - 2

A welcoming page that redirects the user to the homepage was attached. 

## Part - 3

The authentication.php has been supplemented to allow only verified users to access the home page, and those denied get redirected to the denied.php file. 

## Part - 4

In this segment, JQuery Mobile is used to style the overall appearance of the page. All of the connections and features were not altered. 

## Part - 5

The authentication.php was included, but it does not redirect users to an error page; it refreshes to the same page. Some additional features were added, but they are not functional. They will be addressed in the next segments. 

## Part - 6

The focus in this segment is to allow users to upload pictures through the takeaphoto.php file. Additionally, they can verify their current location through location.php; this is accomplished by integrating Google Maps API in the code. 

## Part - 7

Users can finally place ads through this segment with the ad_record.php.
